Arabic Real Book

A collection of Arabic tunes formatted Ã  la Real Book. The [output is published on MuseScore](https://musescore.com/infojunkie/sets/arabicrealbook).

Each tune consists of several files:
- `tune.mscz` - the tune sheet ([MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) file)
- `tune.mma` - the script for the auto-generated accompaniment ([MMA - MIDI Music Accompaniment](http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/) file)
- `tune.mid` - the MIDI file generated by MMA with the above as input
- `tune-mma.mscz` - the MuseScore sheet obtained by importing the MIDI file above

# Building MIDI files
- Install MMA
- Start `timidity -iAD` and edit `./mmarc` to set the MIDI player parameters
- Place a `<tune>.mma` in `tunes/`
- `npm run play <tune>` to preview it
- `npm run build <tune>` to generate its MIDI at `tunes/<tune>.mid`
- `npm run update` to update an MMA Groove in `grooves`. NOTE! This assumes that MMA resides at `/src/music/mma/` - change at will, soorry.
