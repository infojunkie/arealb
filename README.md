Arabic Real Book

A collection of Arabic tunes formatted Ã  la Real Book.

Each tune consists of several files:
- tune.mscz - the tune sheet ([MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) file)
- tune.mma - the script for the auto-generated accompaniment ([MMA - MIDI Music Accompaniment](http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/) file)
- tune.mid - the MIDI file generated by MMA with the above as input
- tune-mma.mscz - the MuseScore sheet obtained by importing the MIDI file above

Eventually, I plan to add an app that manages those files and provides a Web-based player.
