Arabic Real Book

A collection of Arabic tunes formatted Ã  la Real Book. The [output is published on MuseScore](https://musescore.com/infojunkie/sets/arabicrealbook).

Each tune consists of several files:
- `tune.mscz` - the original tune sheet ([MuseScore](https://musescore.org) file)
- `tune.musicxml` - the generated standard tune sheet ([MusicXML](https://w3c.github.io/musicxml/) file)
- `tune.mma` - the accompaniment script ([MMA - MIDI Music Accompaniment](http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/) file)
- `tune.mid` - the MIDI file generated by MMA with the above as input

# Building files
- Install MMA and set `${MMA_HOME}` to point to your MMA installation root
- Start `timidity -iAD` and copy `mmarc.example` to `mmarc` to set the correct MIDI player parameters
